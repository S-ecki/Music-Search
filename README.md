# Firebase-Learning
The aim of this project was to get to know Firebase for Flutter and create a beautiful app while at it.

## App Features

### Music Interpret Search
The user can search for a band or interpret. The result will be a list of all their albums with some additional information. This is done by querying a appropriate database.

### Favourites
The user can select favourite bands, which will be saved. This selection is also stored in Firestore.

## What IÂ´ve learned
- Basic initialization and integration of Firebase
- Querying databases with dart
- Visualizing the results in a user-friendly way
- How quick Flutter can get a small scale, but proper app up and running
