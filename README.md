# Music-Search
The aim of this project is to provide an easy interface to query the works of music artists and bands. Usability testing was part of the process and lead to an improved UI and UX.

## App Features

### Music Interpret Search
The user can search for a band or interpret. The result will be a list of all their albums with some additional information. This is done by querying an appropriate database.

### Favourites
The user can select favourite bands, which will be saved. This selection is also stored in Firestore.

## What IÂ´ve learned
- Usability testing
- The beautiful simplicity of Firebase
- Querying APIs with Dart
- Visualizing the results in a user-friendly way
- How quick Flutter can get a small scale, but proper app up and running
